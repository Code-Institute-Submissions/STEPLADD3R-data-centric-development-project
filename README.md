# Data Centric Development Project
## By Stuart Green

### Project Overview
I was tasked with creating one of three things, I decided to go with the book review and recommendationg site as it seemed like a good example of what a real world project might look like. The goal of this project was to allow users to find books that they would like to read. It would also make a good place for the creator of the app to make a bit of extra money on the side through the use of Amazon Affiliation.

### UX
