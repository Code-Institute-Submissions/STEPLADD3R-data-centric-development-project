# Data Centric Development Project
## By Stuart Green

### Project Overview
I was tasked with creating one of three things, I decided to go with the book review and recommendationg site as it seemed like a good example of what a real world project might look like. The goal of this project was to allow users to find books that they would like to read. It would also make a good place for the creator of the app to make a bit of extra money on the side through the use of Amazon Affiliation.

### UX
Details of the UX design process is available inside the 'user-experience' directory. This directory contains an array of documents that illustrate the UX design process in the form of wireframes.

### Database
Details of the Database design process is available inside the 'database-experience' directory. This directory contains an array of documnents that illustrate how I came to decide on the database collections and fields.

### Features
#### Existing Features
This is a web application that allows users to peruse a list of books and reviews. It is a full stack web application (front-end and back-end) that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to a database. This application uses HTML, CSS and jQuery as the front-end, Python/Flask as the back-end and MongoDB as the database.

Features that the users can utilise:
#### Books
1. Cread Book: Allows users to add a new book and add details that relate to that book, e.g. name, cover photo, genre, etc.
2. Read Book: Allows users to click into the books on the application and read more information regarding the book, as well as read reviews people have posted.
3. Update Book: Allows users to be able to update information on a book, be it one field or many fields.
